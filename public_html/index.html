        [CHAORDIC CHALLENGE]
        
        The challenge is to design and develop a Space Invaders like game in Javascript + HTML (which HTML is up to you).
        
        You don't need to implement the whole game logic, just a few bits of it like listed in the following requirements:

            - The spaceship should move only to the left and right and have borders as their limits;
            - The spaceship should be able to fire bullets. The bullets should go from the top of the spaceship to the top of the game screen if no enemies where shot;
            - The enemies should be randomly placed in the game screen. You don't need to make the enemies move. Maximum of 5 enemies should be in the screen at the same time;
            - If a bullet hits a enemy, the enemy should fade away slowly from the game screen and as soon it fades out completely, a new one should appear in a random position;

        Implementation details like keys to be used won't be taken into account when evaluating your game and code but please document it in order to other to play it.
        
        Be aware, that more important than developing a fun game, you should apply your best software development techniques to it.
